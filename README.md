# Simple TypeScript practice project

This is a simple shopping cart project, used to practice TypeScript.

Main ideas come from [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/lATafp15HWA), however I changed some things in order to sharpen my programming skills.


Instead of using React Router, I took adventage of Next.JS built-in routing.

I also re-created components and most of the styles that come from Bootstrap on my own.

React-Redux with Redux-Toolkit was the replacement for React Context API.

* Please take into account that heroku app might take a while to load.
